          In the last weeks as part of my participation in the prep phase to attend DevBootcamp.com I have been offered several resources to explore how I can maximize my learning experience and get the best out of DevBootcamp and any other experience.<br>
          Two very useful resources I used are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Check Your Personal Thinking Style</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Mind Styles by Anthony Gregorc</a></li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          The rationale behind this theory is to identify various significant usual behaviors in one's approach to life in general, and determine that a pattern emerges which will indicate how one can be best supported to learn and grow in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides this there is another interesting article I considered: <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</a>.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          In  considering these researches I found several points mentioned that certainly applied to my experience when learning. <br>
          I took quite some time to consider how I could this this information to become a better "learner" and overall a better team member and human being. And one important aspect emerged out of this: being open and courageous are probably the most important qualities / key points in one's life.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I go through life I see that whether I am doing something alone or in teams, whether it's work of fun the most important quality I can rely in myself is openness. In collaborating this means to be able to listen deeply to my team and not being afraid of what they can say ("courageous"), instead learn from what they say and focus on what help me.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the first 3 weeks of DevBootcamp I wouldn't say I had big struggles, but the time aspect was challenging. We are expected to go through and learn a lot of material, and I am not surprised that I feel this :)<br>
          What I mentioned above (openness and courage) were certainly the key points that supported me to experience everything and be at ease. The next aspect I can probably benefit from is to be aware of where my time goes and be able to maximize it.
