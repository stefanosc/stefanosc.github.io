          One of the most valuable skills in the post information era is to be able to access the knowledge we need in the vast amount of data that is available at our fingertips. Searching can be daunting at times for the very reason that there is so much information, and unfortunately not always of great quality.<br>
          I feel lucky that I have a natural inclination to clarifying issues and identify how to best search. But what can be helpful for others who don't know exactly what to do? What should be the things to avoid?

          The words that make up the name of this work are rather eloquent. Then consider that this is the fruit of a renowned social psychologist and it doesn't take long to realize that "Stereotype Threat" describes one of the issues we are facing as a global society.

          The use of class or id may seem to serve the same purpose to someone new to CSS but there are some important differences, and some of these differences are rather subtle (yet important) that not even a season developer may have considered. Let's have a quick walk through:
        </p>
        <p>
          In CSS ids and classes are part of CSS selectors, meaning that using them allows you to identify the element which you want to target with your styles. So far so good.

          I took some time today to consider what websites I use, how I use them, what value they bring to my life.

I thought it was worth sharing these considerations because all of them are very valuable to me and they solve great problems.
