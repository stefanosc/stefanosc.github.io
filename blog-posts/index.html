        <h2>Variable Scope</h2>
        <p>The concept of scope pertains to where in a program, variables are assigned and where in your code they are available.</p>
        <p>In a program we can define different scopes as outer and inner (which comes from the code indentation), for example:</p>

          Ruby is one very cool language, that has incredible flexibility and is so clear. To understand classes in Ruby let's consider for a moment how ruby is organized.

          The use of class or id may seem to serve the same purpose to someone new to CSS but there are some important differences, and some of these differences are rather subtle (yet important) that not even a season developer may have considered. Let's have a quick walk through:
        </p>
        <p>
          In CSS ids and classes are part of CSS selectors, meaning that using them allows you to identify the element which you want to target with your styles. So far so good.

          It was good to hear Shereef speak more in detail regarding various aspects of DBC as well as addressing several good questions coming from new participants.

          The one aspect that I can say I appreciate the most of what Shereef demonstrated in this video is the attitude of openness, allow me to explain.

          I took some time today to consider what websites I use, how I use them, what value they bring to my life. I picked 3 different websites, 2 of them related to coding and 1 which I would say is in a category apart. I thought it was worth sharing these considerations because all of them are very valuable to me and they solve great problems.
