        I am just finishing "week-1" of the prep phase for DevBootcamp, and I watched a recorded <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Fireside chat with cofounder Shereef</a>.<br>
        It was good to hear Shereef speak more in detail regarding various aspects of DBC as well as addressing several good questions coming from new participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one aspect that I can say I appreciate the most of what Shereef demonstrated in this video is the attitude of openness, allow me to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few examples will clarify: At some point Shereef talked about the 2 most common fears that everyone  experiences when starting a program like DBC. I think this is still relatively rare in most businesses and organizations and the more standard attitude is to make these topics a tabu or something secret that you only talk to your close friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being able to talk in openness without making anything special is a great step towards creating an environment where everyone feels normal and well respected as they are, without needing to be contrived in any way.<br>
        Several great leaders in history have had the courage to share openly about the experience of being human, and it is very much needed in the world we live in today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another aspect that I appreciate from DevBootcamp is what Shereef described as Restaurant vs Kitchen attitude. To briefly clarify the Restaurant attitude is the attitude of a person that walks into a restaurant and expects to be served whereas the kitchen attitude is that of a person that walks into a kitchen to create and contribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe some aspects need to be clarified in respect to the above. It is good to see that every participant will contribute to DevBootcamp whether they want it or not. Showing up by being open to contribute and considerate about the environment is an important point for anyone working in teams.<br>
        My wish is to contribute towards a respectful, supportive, caring, and empowering environment that allows everyone to grow and contribute their skills to be of benefit to the world.
