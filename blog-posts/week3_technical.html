          JavaScript has experienced a tremendous growth in the last decade projecting it as one of the fastest growing and most popular programming languages used by developers, let's briefly review some of the aspects that brought JavaScript to be so popular.
        </p>

        <h2>JavaScript Pros</h2><br>
        <h3>Speed - client side vs server side</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is executed on the client side, meaning the code is not processed on the server. In this way there is no connectivity lag or any other lag that may be introduced by the server and connectivity to it. It just all happens on the user side
        </p>

        <h3>Versatility - any browser can interpret it</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript makes for a super versatile language. Because practically any browser can interpret this language it can be integrated in any web application or website making it a great complement to any web project regardless of the core language used.
        </p>

        <h3>Ease of Use</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a simple language, the learning curve is less steep compared to other languages making it an easy choice for many developers.<br>
          Of course this doesn't mean JavaScript can't be used to create complex web applications and in fact quite the opposite. A multitude of frameworks have emerged in recent years to providing great solution to build feature rich web applications, some popular frameworks are <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> and <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>
        </p>

        <h2>JavaScript Cons</h2><br>

        <h3>Security issues</h3>
        <p>
          Because JavaScript is processed on the client side it is more susceptible to malicious attacks.<br>
          Malicious snippets of JavaScript could compromise the security of the user's computer.
        </p>

        <h3>Inconsistency of implementations</h3>
        <p>
          Despite JavaScript great popularity, it's implementation among different browsers historically has not been standard, and although many efforts have been made to standardize it as a language, cross browser compatibility is still an issue.<br>
          This is why frameworks like <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> were introduced.
