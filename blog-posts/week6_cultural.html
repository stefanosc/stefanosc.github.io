        <p>
          In the past few days I was invited to conduct some research about "Stereotype Threat", an important work from renowned social psychologist Claude Mason Steele.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words that make up the name of this work are rather eloquent. Then consider that this is the fruit of a renowned social psychologist and it doesn't take long to realize that "Stereotype Threat" describes one of the issues we are facing as a global society.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first line on the Wikipedia page on the subject:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          And this is the third line on the same Wikipedia page:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Stereotype threat has been shown to reduce the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          As I read and familiarized myself with this research it became obvious to me that at some point in my life I felt it and at some other point in my life I even caused it to a greater or lesser degree.<br>
          It became clear that this is surely a problem in today's global society. One of the aspects that perhaps surprised me the most is that it's hard for me to remember the last time I felt it, it is hard because it's many years, if not decades since I felt it or since I emphasized someone else's feelings in this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel very lucky to be in this position, since it is clear that this issue is affecting many social interactions. I believe the last times I experienced Stereotype Threat was probably when I was a teenager going to high school. I surely experienced it other times later in adult life as well but it seems my choices lead me to be more and more in environments where these kind of social issues are simply not part of the relationships I nurture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have I done something right? or am I just avoiding this issue? I feel this is a good reality check to assess my life on the spot.<br>
          My focus in life is to contribute to world to be of benefit to all thanks to the great inspiration and support of the Balanced View non profit organization.<br>
          I have devoted time to get to know myself "as I am" beyond any idea of social group, ethnicity, sex, financial means, language, skills, preferences, likes, dislikes or stereotype threat.<br>
          In knowing myself simply "as I am" before any concept, it is natural to see everyone else in the same way. I am so lucky to share life with countless friends all over the world that see me and everyone else without any filter.<br>
          In these relationship the issues described by Stereotype Threat are simply not part of the equation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the most important qualities in contributing to such a supportive, empowering, and loving environment are openness, and willingness to be contributed by those who went before us. This is how I go through my life, learning from great leaders how to be of great benefit to all.
