        <p>
          I thought I'd write a few words regarding some of the values that have shaped up to be the key values in all my relationships and for very good reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I look back in my life I notice how I have gone through many lessons, where I made mistakes, I learned, I did things I am proud of, I nurtured great relationships, and I broke others (and others were broken).
          We can all state the above, it's surely part of life. What I find incredible and at times unintuitive is that in all these experiences integrity and openness where always among the top 3 qualities / aspects that supported me the most and enabled me to make the best of any circumstance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most powerful and most beneficial circumstances were when openness and integrity were somewhat unintuitive. When it felt that being completely open was "dangerous" for example, or uncomfortable to say the least, allowing myself to open up and relate to others with no goal and objectives, simply considering how to be of best support turned out to be a transformative experience where everyone involved felt completely respected, supported and appreciated.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I think of integrity I think of 2 main circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>honoring a commitment</li>
          <li>being unable to honor a commitment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Again, I consider the most rewarding experience the one that felt somewhat not so pleasant in some way, at least initially.
          Nobody likes to not honor a commitment and some times there are serious consequences to this. But even when there are no obvious consequences the most important aspect to me has been to learn that as a human being I make mistakes, we all do at times. In this the key is to take responsibility for my action and make amends when my actions affect others causing issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          It takes courage to do this and it's a great muscle to exercise, being willing to go where it doesn't seem to feel good if necessary and notice how making integrity and openness the basis of the relationship I build has contributed greatly in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I wrote above I do make mistakes from time to time and these are key circumstances where I can learn and grow in my ability to be the very best I can be.
