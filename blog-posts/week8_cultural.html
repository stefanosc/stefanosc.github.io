        <h1>Empowering Conflict</h1>

          As human society unfortunately we are not yet conflict free and often the way it is experienced is dis-empowering and fosters further conflict. Today I would like to share briefly a few key points that I feel very lucky to have learned that have supported me in a great way to face conflict and resolve it in the best possible way.
        </p>
        <p>
          A very important point is to see that deeply I really don't want to foster conflict. If I consider for a moment the truth is that, like everyone, I love having harmonious and loving relationships.<br>
          When facing conflict it can be easy to say "Yes, but...!", and sure enough I have done that myself in my life. Luckily I have learned more and more to keep the focus on myself and see conflict as an opportunity to face the emotions that arise rather than an opportunity to express them and blame someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I grow I realize more and more clearly that at some level it really doesn't matter at the end of the day what happens. What is most important is how we can be of benefit to ourselves and others in our life.<br>
          By maintaining the focus on being of benefit to all, it's easy to see my interactions as an opportunity to live this purpose in day to day life.
