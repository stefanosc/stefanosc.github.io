          I started pairing in programming not too long ago, although I have been involved in technology for several years, as a consultant, and I shared, trained, and supported many great people I only began pairing around May 2013 as part of a new project, and with my participation in DevBootcamp, I now pair about 4 times a week with many talented and motivated developers and soon to be developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been an incredible experience, during which I have benefited in so many incredible ways and most importantly I have grown in my capacity to benefit others with my experience and presence.<br>
          In the many months I learned so much from my pairs, and I am so happy I was also able to share so many cool tips and tricks as well as contributing to make the pairing session a relaxed and joyful experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of DevBootcamp we are required to leave feedback to each other every time we pair. It has been a good experience to give and receive feedback. I am so honored to have received very brilliant feedback always appreciating my contribution and experience, I did receive a few suggestions too, for example, an invitation to further clarify and refine my ability to express my thoughts concisely and clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for how I have experienced giving feedback, it has been a truly enriching experience, helping me to give everything I have an more to truly empower and support my pair. This has been a key aspect in relating in general and even more so when I am required to explicitly give feedback to another person.<br>
          I feel lucky to have learned to make the focus of all my qualities and activities the empowerment and benefit of others. I find not only it helps me build beautiful nourishing relationships, and contribute to the world; the most surprising aspect is probably that this is such a natural disposition
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing myself and being clear on how I want to live my life truly helped me making each pairing session such a great opportunity to benefit and be of benefit in many ways. What a cool way to collaborate!
