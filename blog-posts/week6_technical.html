        <h1>Scope in ruby Programs</h1>
        <p class="date">Oct 4th, 2014</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-body">
        <p>
          Today I would like to review the concept of scope.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Variable Scope</h2>
        <p>The concept of scope pertains to where in a program, variables are assigned and where in your code they are available.</p>
        <p>In a program we can define different scopes as outer and inner (which comes from the code indentation), for example:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-ruby">outer_var = "hi I am an outer variable"

2.times do
  puts outer_var + " and I am sent to the screen from an inner scope"
end
        </code></pre>
        <p>The <strong>outer scope</strong> is where we assign the "outer_var", whereas the <strong>inner scope</strong> is where we "<code>puts outer_var"</code></p>
        <p>As we can immediately understand is that a variable declared in an outer scope is available to an inner scope.It does not work the other way around, so if we had:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-ruby">2.times do
  outer_var = "hi I am an inner variable"
end

puts outer_var + " and I am sent to the screen from an outer scope
        </code></pre>
        <p>The above would through an error of this kind:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-ruby">NameError: undefined local variable or method `outer_var' for main:Object</code></pre>
        <p>So we can summarize easily by saying:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is always available in the scope where is it assigned and at any inner scope</li>
          <li>A variable is not available to an outer scope from the one where the variable was assigned</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Pass by Reference vs Pass by Value</h2>
        <p>here I would like to start with a great quote</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Methods have no access to anything that hasn't been passed in, except constants or global variables. Instance methods in classes have access to instance and class variables.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I very much enjoyed this description of what methods have access to.<br />and I would like to add one small addition saying that what is passed to a method is called the argument.<br />As an example:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-ruby">def my_method argument
  puts argument
end
        </code></pre>

        <p>In the above method the argument is a value that I pass to the method, so if I write:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-ruby">
my_method(my_variable)
        </code></pre>

        <p>I pass the "my_variable" to the method so that its value is available to the method.<br /><br /></p>
        <p>Now in terms of passing by reference or by value I will ask myself a question to further illustrate the concept:<br />When I pass "my_variable" as argument to "my_method" so that its content is available to method what am I passing really?<br />If I was passing by value I would pass simply the content of the object assigned to the variable without making any reference to the object itself. <br />If I was passing by reference I would simply pass a pointer to the object assigned to the variable</p>
        <p>In general it is said that in ruby objects are passed by value, and not by reference with one little quirk:</p>
        <p>If in "my_method" I use a method that mutate the object that is calling it then the method will mutate "my_variable" although it was passed by value, here is an example:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-ruby">
def my_method argument
  argument.capitalize!
end
        </code></pre>
        <p>This would not only capitalize the argument but also mutate "my_variable".</p>
        <p>And finally one last detail:</p>
        <p>Numbers (integers and floats) have no mutating methods so they will never, ever change if you pass them to a method.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-ruby">
a = 1
some_method(a)
  puts a

# the above will always always  always show as '1'
        </code></pre>
        <p>And this concludes my notes on variables and methods today!</p>
