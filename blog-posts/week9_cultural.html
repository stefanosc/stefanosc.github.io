          One of the most valuable skills in the post information era is to be able to access the knowledge we need in the vast amount of data that is available at our fingertips. Searching can be daunting at times for the very reason that there is so much information, and unfortunately not always of great quality.<br>
          I feel lucky that I have a natural inclination to clarifying issues and identify how to best search. But what can be helpful for others who don't know exactly what to do? What should be the things to avoid?
        </p>
        <h2>Laziness</h2>
        <p>
          I think the main issue is probably laziness. Too often we are just used to just ask the first thing that comes to mind without taking enough time to consider how to expose the problem effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my experience taking time to review the issue and see if we can understand it is a very good practice. Sure if I understand it, I wouldn't really need to ask for help. But the best next thing we can do is take time to describe the issue as if we had to be able to replicate the issue on another machine.
        </p>
        <h2>Define the Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Usually by taking time to define the problem so that it can replicated we can not only support others in helping us finding the solution but also may stumble upon the solution ourselves, which is the best part!
