      <h1>Comparing 3 websites I love</h1>

      <p>
        I took some time today to consider what websites I use, how I use them, what value they bring to my life. I picked 3 different websites, 2 of them related to coding and 1 which I would say is in a category apart. I thought it was worth sharing these considerations because all of them are very valuable to me and they solve great problems.
      </p>

      <h2>MassiveVibe.com</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.MassiveVibe.com">MassiveVibe.com</a> is a project that spawned from the incredible <a href="http://www.balancedview.org">Balanced View team</a> inspired and led by founder <a href="http://candiceodenver.com/">Candice O' Denver</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am totally in love with the production of MassiveVibe. I find it to be a unique mix of elements put together in such a way to deliver a remarkable user experience. <br>
        The website itself is very simple at the moment of writing, but the graphics used in the design are delightful and greatly inspiring.
        The videos produced and the videos of recorded events display how Balanced View is fostering a world peace in many different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        All artists come together sharing deeply inspiring lyrics with very great talent. I am touched by how the teams involved always work in a very loving, supportive, empowering way.<br>
        MassiveVibe.com is the perfect representation of all these remarkable qualities and that's why I completely love this website, which is still in its infancy, and I am very excited by its potential to bring great benefit to the world.
      </p>

      <h2>StackOverflow.com</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.StackOverflow.com">StackOverflow.com</a> is probably one of the top 3 resources for any developer. As I have grown more and more familiar with code and code related tasks I landed on StackOverflow countless times, and most of them probably through Google searches.<br>
        What makes this website such a valuable resource is that very often it represents that handy solution that you just needed to fix a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a design perspective I find it very functional and not necessarily very design focused yet it's still rather pleasant to use. The objectives that drive its user interface are all related at delivering solutions fast, really fast.<br>
        This explains why the most prominent elements of the interface are probably the 5 gray buttons and 1 orange button (the "Ask Question" button) that are at the top of the page.<br>
        They stand out, they are so easy to see and to use and they will easily lead you exactly where you want to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        StackOverflow is not only great at delivering valuable information, but it also promotes generosity and altruism creating a system where developers can help each other without wanting anything in return.<br>
        Overall a really great resource with a great infrastructure behind its front end.
      </p>

      <h2>GitHub.com</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.GitHub.com">GitHub.com</a> is another fantastic developer resource. For starters it is the home of countless great open source projects, to mention a few: Ruby, Node.js, jQuery, Ruby on Rails, Angular.js, Bootstrap and many more.<br>
        Many of these projects literally power a very great part (and growing) of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        I very much like what GitHub has accomplished in fostering open source and social coding. It has certainly contributed greatly to connect developers and inspire them to contribute to many different projects. <br>
        The GitHub platform offers very useful features that take take git to the next level.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a design perspective I find GitHub very pleasant and easy to use in general. The search feature I feel could be improved in some way for example allowing to search anything when browsing a repository rather than just "This repository".<br>
        Other than this GitHub remains a greatly useful website with a clean interface, easy to use.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I deeply appreciate the websites above mentioned and I am so happy that more and more we, the people of the world, come together to contribute together to be of benefit.
