          In the last days as part of my participation in DevBootcamp I conducted some research, and considered as a technology lover what are the biggest issues that affect this marvelous industry.<br>
          One main aspect that has been discussed in depth and continues to be considered is the <em>diversity issue</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was just last July that Twitter released their first "<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/building-a-twitter-we-can-be-proud-of">diversity report</a>" and there have been several articles pointing this report mainly addressing the issues of race and gender inequality.<br>
          The numbers speak for themselves: 90% of global employees in Technology are men, with only 10% women. As for ethnicity 58% are white and 34% are Asian.<br>
          The other part of the numbers that I find interesting is that Tech as an industry does not seem to be a the best example of diversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In taking time considering how we got here, it has become clear that this is simply the result of the education that we have been subjected to as human culture.<br>
          At a most fundamental level it's a matter of how the majority of the people still identifies themselves and others with outdated ideas of gender, roles, expectations, just because we were born in a specific location, with a specific ethnicity and gender.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what can we do really? <br>
          It just happens that this and so many other issues that we experience as the people of the world are very important to me. I decided long time ago that what is most important is to live a life in complete openness, gratitude, and kindness without limiting myself in this for any reason not for any idea or concept! I made this my lifestyle and this is what I aspire to be in every interaction I have with all beings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am supported and inspired to live a life that is of benefit to all by <a href="http://www.balancedview.org">Balanced View</a>, and I feel blessed to share such an enriching existence with countless friends all over the world
