          The use of class or id may seem to serve the same purpose to someone new to CSS but there are some important differences, and some of these differences are rather subtle (yet important) that not even a season developer may have considered. Let's have a quick walk through:
        </p>
        <p>
          In CSS ids and classes are part of CSS selectors, meaning that using them allows you to identify the element which you want to target with your styles. So far so good.
        </p>



        <h2>Ids are unique</h2>
        <p>
          One main aspect of ids is their uniqueness:
        </p>

          <ul>
            <li>If you assign an id to an element, that id can only appear once on the page</li>
            <li>you can only assign 1 id to an element (no element can have more than 1 id)</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          It's clear that Ids allow to identify one and only one specific element.
        </p>

        <h2>Classes need not to be unique</h2>
        <p>
          Classes unlike Ids can be repeated as many times you want on a document and in fact this is a very common use for classes. Very often they are used to identify elements that are part of a specific section of the content.
        </p>

        <h2>Selector Specificity</h2>
        <p>
          Selector specificity is a concept related to the "cascading" aspect of CSS. It is how the browser selects which properties to apply based on selectors that identify the same element. When there are more selectors pointing to the same element the one with higher specificity will "win".<br>
          For further details there is a great explanation over the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity">Mozilla Developer Network: Specificity</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The main aspect to keep in mind is that Ids have higher specificity than Classes.
        </p>

        <h2>Use Them Only if Needed, Stick with Classes if You Can</h2>
        <p>
          Classes and Ids are great ways to identify elements on the document that otherwise would not be easy to select, bearing this in mind we want to ask ourselves: can I do this without a class or id attribute?
        </p>

        <p>
          In relation to this I came across a very informative article lately: <a href="http://oli.jp/2011/ids/">Donâ€™t use IDs in CSS selectors?</a><br>
          Oli Studholme, the author of the article, after running some benchmarks found that using the id alone in a selector is as expected faster than a class.<br>
          The very surprising aspect is that using another selector as a descendant of an id is about 15% slower than using a class. This is most likely not going to be a bottle neck in your website / web app unless you clutter your markup with bad selector, but I Oli goes over a few other reasons why it's best to not use Ids often for styling and keep for when they are really needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope you found this useful!
