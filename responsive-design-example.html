    <h2>What is Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>
      In order to understand responsive design we need to first define other approaches / strategies used in web design, in fact responsive design at the basic level is a combination of fluid layouts and adaptive layouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluid layouts leverage the ability of CSS to specify the size of elements in percentages and other relative measures (em). The advantage of a fluid layout is that the elements on the page automatically adjust as the vieport changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adaptive layout use mainly @media queries as standardized in CSS3 to apply different styles based on the various conditions. The most common condition to use is to change styles based on viewport width.<br>
      With adaptive layout we could for example hide an element on mobile devices or change its position.
    </p>
    <p>
      When used skillfully the combination of fluid and adaptive layouts can modify the user experience to make it optimal on all devices.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Learned Today</h2>
    <p>
      It's been an incredible challenge, during which I learned so much in many ways and it has also been a great and so much fun experience to pair with a fellow developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      By focusing and giving myself time limits I have been able to quickly clarify the main concepts beyond responsive web design.
      I was able to further solidify my understanding of css positioning and then implement relative dimensions to make the layout fluid.<br>
      It was good to review the use of the @media query in CSS and understand how we can use it to define styles based on different parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      My pair and I both had a good aha moment when we clarified how to scale font size based on viewport. Initially we were unsure how to best implement the scaling of fonts and after a quick research and some testing it was clear that we needed to use @media queries.<br>
      A great question on StackOverflow was helpful <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15649244/responsive-font-size">Responsive Font Size</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Resources: viewport meta tag and @viewport CSS rule</h2>
    <p>
      In the process of clarifying the different aspects of responsive design I wanted to clarify the role of the viewport meta tag.<br>
      This is a key aspect in creating responsive designs. I found great article on tutsplus.com : <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/quick-tip-dont-forget-the-viewport-meta-tag--webdesign-5972">Quick Tip: Don't Forget the Viewport Meta Tag</a>.
